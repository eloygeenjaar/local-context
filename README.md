# local-global

## November 6 findings
With task data, we can find these clearly defined clusters even without global information.
However, with task data (specifically fBIRN) we are not getting clusters yet. It seems like subjects are too mixed together and stay in their own part of the latent space.
Trying: adding global information to mediate this.
